# wayback-progit

A backup of [Pro Git book](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2), written by Scott Chacon and Ben Straub, as well as [中文版](https://git-scm.com/book/zh/v2).

Site is powered by [mkdocs](https://github.com/mkdocs/mkdocs), theme is [mkdocs-material](https://github.com/squidfunk/mkdocs-material).

Here, I use `asciidoctor` and `pandoc` to convert raw asciidoc texts into markdown texts by scripts.
