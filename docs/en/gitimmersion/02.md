# *lab 2* More Setup

## Goals

- Get the tutorial materials setup and ready to run.

## Get the Tutorial package

- Download from: <https://gitimmersion.com/git_tutorial.zip>

## Unzip the tutorial

The tutorial package should have a main directory “git_tutorial” with
three sub-directories:

- html — These html files. Point your browser to html/index.html
- work — An empty working directory. Create your repos in here.
- repos — Prepackaged Git repositories so you can jump into the tutorial
  at any point. If you get stuck, just copy the desired lab into your
  working directory.
