# *lab 44* Pulling Changes

## Goals

- Learn that `git pull` is equivalent to a `git fetch` followed by a
  `git merge`.

## Discussion

Weâ€™re not going to go through the process of creating another change and
pulling it again, but we do want you to know that doing:

``` instructions
git pull
```

is indeed equivalent to the two steps:

``` instructions
git fetch
git merge origin/main
```
