# *lab 36* Multiple Repositories

Up to this point we have been working with a single git repository.
However, git excels at working with multiple repositories. These extra
repositories may be stored locally, or may be accessed across a network
connection.

In the next section we will create a new repository called
“cloned_hello”. We will show how to move changes from one repository to
another, and how to handle conflicts when they arise between two
repositories.

For now, we will be working with local repositories (i.e. repositories
stored on your local hard disk), however most of the things learned in
this section will apply to multiple repositories whether they are stored
locally or remotely over a network.

**NOTE:** We are going be making changes to both copies of our
repositories. Make sure you pay attention to which repository you are in
at each step of the following labs.
