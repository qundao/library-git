# *lab 4* Checking Status

## Goals

- Learn how to check the status of the repository

## Check the status of the repository

Use the `git status` command to check the current status of the
repository.

### **Execute:**

``` instructions
git status
```

You should see

### **Output:**

``` sample
$ git status
On branch main
nothing to commit, working tree clean
```

The status command reports that there is nothing to commit. This means
that the repository has all the current state of the working directory.
There are no outstanding changes to record.

We will use the `git status` command to continue to monitor the state
between the repository and the working directory.
