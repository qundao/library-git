# *lab 28* Merging

## Goals

- Learn how to merge two diverging branches to bring the changes back
  into a single branch.

## Merge the branches

Merging brings the changes in two branches together. Letâ€™s go back to
the greet branch and merge main onto greet.

### **Execute:**

``` instructions
git checkout greet
git merge main
git hist --all
```

### **Output:**

``` sample
$ git checkout greet
Switched to branch 'greet'
$ git merge main
Merge made by the 'recursive' strategy.
 README | 1 +
 1 file changed, 1 insertion(+)
 create mode 100644 README
$ git hist --all

```

By merging main into your greet branch periodically, you can pick up any
changes to main and keep your changes in greet compatible with changes
in the mainline.

However, it does produce ugly commit graphs. Later we will look at the
option of rebasing rather than merging.

## Up Next

But first, what if the changes in main conflict with the changes in
greet?
