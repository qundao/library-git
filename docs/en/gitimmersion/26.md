# *lab 26* Changes in Main

## Goals

- Learning how to deal with multiple branches with different (and
  possibly conflicting) changes.

While you were changing the greet branch, someone else decided to update
the main branch. They added a README.

## Switch to the main branch.

### **Execute:**

``` instructions
git checkout main
```

## Create the README.

### *README*

``` file
This is the Hello World example from the git tutorial.
```

## Commit the README to main.

### **Execute:**

``` instructions
git add README
git commit -m "Added README"
```
