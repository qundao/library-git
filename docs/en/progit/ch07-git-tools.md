## Git Tools

By now, you’ve learned most of the day-to-day commands and workflows
that you need to manage or maintain a Git repository for your source
code control. You’ve accomplished the basic tasks of tracking and
committing files, and you’ve harnessed the power of the staging area and
lightweight topic branching and merging.

Now you’ll explore a number of very powerful things that Git can do that
you may not necessarily use on a day-to-day basis but that you may need
at some point.

### Summary

You’ve seen a number of advanced tools that allow you to manipulate your
commits and staging area more precisely. When you notice issues, you
should be able to easily figure out what commit introduced them, when,
and by whom. If you want to use subprojects in your project, you’ve
learned how to accommodate those needs. At this point, you should be
able to do most of the things in Git that you’ll need on the command
line day to day and feel comfortable doing so.
