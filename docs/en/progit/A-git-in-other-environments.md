## Appendix A: Git in Other Environments

If you read through the whole book, you’ve learned a lot about how to
use Git at the command line. You can work with local files, connect your
repository to others over a network, and work effectively with others.
But the story doesn’t end there; Git is usually used as part of a larger
ecosystem, and the terminal isn’t always the best way to work with it.
Now we’ll take a look at some of the other kinds of environments where
Git can be useful, and how other applications (including yours) work
alongside Git.

### Summary

You’ve learned how to harness Git’s power from inside the tools that you
use during your everyday work, and also how to access Git repositories
from your own programs.
