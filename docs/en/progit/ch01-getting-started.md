## Getting Started

This chapter will be about getting started with Git. We will begin by
explaining some background on version control tools, then move on to how
to get Git running on your system and finally how to get it set up to
start working with. At the end of this chapter you should understand why
Git is around, why you should use it and you should be all set up to do
so.

### Summary

You should have a basic understanding of what Git is and how it’s
different from any centralized version control systems you may have been
using previously. You should also now have a working version of Git on
your system that’s set up with your personal identity. It’s now time to
learn some Git basics.
