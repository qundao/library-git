### Git in IntelliJ / PyCharm / WebStorm / PhpStorm / RubyMine

JetBrains IDEs (such as IntelliJ IDEA, PyCharm, WebStorm, PhpStorm,
RubyMine, and others) ship with a Git Integration plugin. It provides a
dedicated view in the IDE to work with Git and GitHub Pull Requests.

The integration relies on the command-line Git client, and requires one
to be installed. The official documentation is available at
[https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/using-git-integration.html](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/using-git-integration.html).
