## Git Basics

If you can read only one chapter to get going with Git, this is it. This
chapter covers every basic command you need to do the vast majority of
the things you’ll eventually spend your time doing with Git. By the end
of the chapter, you should be able to configure and initialize a
repository, begin and stop tracking files, and stage and commit changes.
We’ll also show you how to set up Git to ignore certain files and file
patterns, how to undo mistakes quickly and easily, how to browse the
history of your project and view changes between commits, and how to
push and pull from remote repositories.

### Summary

At this point, you can do all the basic local Git operations — creating
or cloning a repository, making changes, staging and committing those
changes, and viewing the history of all the changes the repository has
been through. Next, we’ll cover Git’s killer feature: its branching
model.
