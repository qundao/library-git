## GitHub

GitHub is the single largest host for Git repositories, and is the
central point of collaboration for millions of developers and projects.
A large percentage of all Git repositories are hosted on GitHub, and
many open-source projects use it for Git hosting, issue tracking, code
review, and other things. So while it’s not a direct part of the Git
open source project, there’s a good chance that you’ll want or need to
interact with GitHub at some point while using Git professionally.

This chapter is about using GitHub effectively. We’ll cover signing up
for and managing an account, creating and using Git repositories, common
workflows to contribute to projects and to accept contributions to
yours, GitHub’s programmatic interface and lots of little tips to make
your life easier in general.

If you are not interested in using GitHub to host your own projects or
to collaborate with other projects that are hosted on GitHub, you can
safely skip to
