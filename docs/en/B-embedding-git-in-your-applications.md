## Appendix A: Embedding Git in your Applications

If your application is for developers, chances are good that it could
benefit from integration with source control. Even non-developer
applications, such as document editors, could potentially benefit from
version-control features, and Git’s model works very well for many
different scenarios.

If you need to integrate Git with your application, you have essentially
two options: spawn a shell and call the `git` command-line program, or
embed a Git library into your application. Here we’ll cover command-line
integration and several of the most popular embeddable Git libraries.

1.  [command-line](book/B-embedding-git/sections/command-line.md)

2.  [libgit2](book/B-embedding-git/sections/libgit2.md)

3.  [jgit](book/B-embedding-git/sections/jgit.md)

4.  [go-git](book/B-embedding-git/sections/go-git.md)
